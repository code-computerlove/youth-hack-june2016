# Manchester Youth Hack June 2016

#####The Challenge
The Olympics are looming and soon we’ll all be searching for information on sports, athletes and the participating countries for this year’s event.

Here at Code we have gathered data around search terms related to the Olympics and the number of searches. We’d like you to create the most fun thing possible from this dataset. This could be a game, interactive visualisation or whatever else you can think of! Be creative!
